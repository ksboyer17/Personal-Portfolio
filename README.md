# Kenny Boyer's Personal Portfolio
A portfolio displaying my personal work. 

This project was made in VS Code using CSS and HTML. 

This project was designed to offer people a place to view my work as a developer. The site is not currently finished and still needs Javascript aspects added, as well as additional published work on the "My Projects" page. I used html elements and a clean structure to ensure that the code is easy for other developers to view and also to make the site more accessible.  

How to access my code and structure:
- Please visit my the projects GitHub repository "Personal-Portfolio", link can be found below
- There are two HTML documents and one CSS stylesheet generating the site

Functionality of the Website:
1. The website has a Nav bar with working links to take you to the section of the page you desire to navigate to
2. Working page link to a seperate projects page (one in the Nav bar, one functioning link on the middle "projects" tile)
3. The social media tile has clickable social media links.
4. Once you click one of the project links you will have the ability to navigate back to the previous page by clicking the "About Me" link or the "Social Media" link.
5. On the Projects page users also have the ability to click any tile and they will be directed to Google as a temporary place holder. Once additonal work is developed consumers will be directed to my deployed work.
6. Users will also notice hover elements throughout the website including when users hover over tiles and Nav bar links.
7. Contact information and a clickable email link can be located in the footer of the page.
